# Efficient-Route-Search-Models-for-Dynamic-Environments

Existing cognitively motivated path search models ignore that we are hardly ever alone when navigating through an environment. They neither account for traffic nor for the social costs that being routed through certain areas may incur. [In this paper](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/13049/), we analyse the effects of “not being alone” on different path search models, in particular on fastest paths and least complex paths. We find a significant effect of aiming to avoid traffic on social costs, but interestingly only minor effects on path complexity when minimizing either traffic load or social costs. Further, we find that ignoring traffic in path search leads to significantly increased average traffic load for all tested models. We also present results of a combined model that accounts for complexity, traffic, and social costs at the same time. Overall, this research provides important insights into the behavior of path search models when optimizing for different aspects, and explores some ways of mitigating unwanted effects.
